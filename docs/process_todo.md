## The types of tests we can use

- Unit and integration tests

  These tests we can write during development process and run them locally before commit changes to the repository. These tests can be also run automatically by CI platform like Travis CI.

- Acceptance and UI Tests

  These tests can be also run by Travis on the built application to check if it works correctly.

- Smoke tests

  These tests can be run on production to check if the application works in general.

- Performance tests

  Such tests can be make by some monitoring tools on production application.
